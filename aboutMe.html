        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Jesse, and who I am is much less important than what I'm about, which we'll get to shortly. For the last 10 years, I've dedicated myself to the field of fitness and wellness - kinesiology, health promotion, personal training, group fitness, life coaching, culinary arts, and yoga. All in the pursuit of making myself whole, because for a large part of my life I haven't felt that way. Constantly comparing myself to others, poor body image, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, depression, you name it, I've experienced it all. Long story short I found that by focusing on the things that I can change—like what I eat, how often I move, and what I think about—I can make a huge difference in my life. And now I'm all about making that difference in other peoples lives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now enter the other side of my educational journey - Array, School of Technology and Design. Possibly the complete opposite of what I'd been doing the previous ten years. It's here that I began to realize the immense impact developers and engineers have on the future of our world. Not only am I in awe of the potential technology has to transform our lives, I'm also in awe of the individuals who aspire to use that technology to enhance the lives of others.

        <p>In reality what we do is much more than coaching. With my diverse background, you can tap into all areas fitness and wellness. You get all the perks that come with having a personal trainer, chef, and performance coach. Sidenote - I won't actually be preparing your meals unless you want to fly me to your location :) However, that's part of the beauty of coaching; it's super convenient for the both of us and can take place anywhere as long as each of us has access to a computer or phone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Coaching is one of the most effective ways to create new habits and eliminate old ones because it targets the most important aspect of change, behavior. Together we look at how you're currently operating in the world, identify what's working, and what's not. Basically, we're reprogramming/rebuilding a lifestyle that results in you feeling successful, energized, and healthy. Bonus! You get to look and feel awesome.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Your body is the most valuable possession you have.</p>
