        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Jesse, and who I am is much less important than what I'm about, which we'll get to shortly. For the last 10 years, I've dedicated myself to the field of fitness and wellness - kinesiology, health promotion, personal training, group fitness, life coaching, culinary arts, and yoga. All in the pursuit of making myself whole, because for a large part of my life I haven't felt that way. Constantly comparing myself to others, poor body image, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, depression, you name it, I've experienced it all. Long story short I found that by focusing on the things that I can change—like what I eat, how often I move, and what I think about—I can make a huge difference in my life. And now I'm all about making that difference in other peoples lives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now enter the other side of my educational journey - Array, School of Technology and Design. Possibly the complete opposite of what I'd been doing the previous ten years. It's here that I began to realize the immense impact developers and engineers have on the future of our world. Not only am I in awe of the potential technology has to transform our lives, I'm also in awe of the individuals who aspire to use that technology to enhance the lives of others.
